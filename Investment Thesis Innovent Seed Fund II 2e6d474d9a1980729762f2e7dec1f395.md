> 

We are founder-first and traction-obsessed. We care less about stage or industry labels and more about the multiplication of factors that predict outsized outcomes.

## What We Do

We invest in **software-led companies**, including AI-native systems, that attack acute, recurring points of pain inside the world's largest and fastest-growing industries.

## Fund At A Glance

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Fund Size | $1.5M |
| Check Size | $250K average |
| Portfolio | ~6 companies |
| Valuation Cap | Up to $30M pre-money |
| Target ARR | $500K – $3M |

# Investment Philosophy

## Founder-First, Traction-Obsessed

We don't invest in decks or TAM slides. We invest in **proof**, real customers adopting at a meaningful clip, led by teams who can accelerate that momentum with capital.

### The Three Pillars

**Traction**

- $500K – $3M in ARR demonstrates real market pull
- Paying customers who aren't friends, family, or favors
- Healthy retention, no leaky buckets, demonstrable adoption and user delight
- Growth showing momentum beyond founder-led sales or long tail enterprise clients

**Team**

- Domain expertise that unlocks unfair advantages
- Founders with 20%+ ownership each who are building for the long term
- Technical and business co-founders required
- Experience, professionalism, drive, stamina, IQ, EQ, demonstrated judgment

**Capital**

- Sub-$30M valuation creates room for meaningful returns, never more than 20x ACTUAL ARR, average never more than 10x ARR
- Path to $1B outcome at reasonable exit scenarios, path to next round / sustainability without additional assumptions
- Burn multiple under control (<2x), Capital efficiency (know your ARR/FTE by heart)

## AI as Accelerant, Not Thesis

AI is transforming every industry. But we don't invest in "AI companies", we invest in **great companies that leverage AI** to deliver immediate value. The technology is an accelerant, not the thesis itself.

# Value Chain Framework

We back two investment archetypes with equal conviction:

## Inside the Value Chain

*Execution Layers*

Companies that **own critical workflows** and replace human coordination. They become indispensable because removing them breaks operations.

**Characteristics:**

- System-of-action: submits, reconciles, routes, settles, schedules
- Writes back to systems of record
- High switching costs from workflow lock-in
- Action/outcome data creates compounding moats

**Examples by Industry:**

- **Healthcare:** Prior-authorization submission, denial management, revenue cycle execution
- **Finance:** Claims processing, automated reconciliation, collections execution
- **Logistics:** Exception resolution, carrier tendering, rerouting
- **Construction:** RFI/submittal routing, progress verification tied to payments
- **Manufacturing:** Production scheduling, work-order execution

## On Top of the Value Chain

*Coordination Layers*

Companies that **aggregate fragmented systems** and become unavoidable standards through market share and network effects.

**Characteristics:**

- Dashboards, copilots, analytics, AI drafting tools
- Consumes data from underlying systems
- Produces insights, recommendations, interfaces
- Wins by becoming the coordination layer ecosystems converge on

**Examples:**

- Predictive alerts and forecasting
- Workflow orchestration platforms
- Cross-system analytics and reporting
- AI-powered recommendations and copilots

# Market Thesis

## The Opportunity: Distribution Tech

We focus on **"Distribution Tech"**, companies that help other businesses do business. Smarter. Faster. Better.

These are software-led companies attacking trillion-dollar industries where:

- **Complexity creates opportunity:** Regulatory requirements, physical constraints, and operational friction prevent commoditization
- **Software penetration is low:** Massive markets with <10% digital adoption
- **Labor alone can't scale:** Industries need systems that reduce friction, compress cycle time, and increase throughput
- **Clear ROI exists:** Budgeted operational pain with demonstrable 10x value

## Why Now: The AI Inflection

According to Bessemer's State of AI 2025 research, we're witnessing the biggest wave of technology change in history. Key insights:

### Two AI Startup Archetypes

| Metric | Supernovas | Shooting Stars |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Year 1 ARR | $40M | $3M |
| Year 2 ARR | $125M | $12M |
| Gross Margin | ~25% | ~60% |
| ARR/FTE | $1.13M | $164K |

**We focus on Shooting Stars**, companies with sustainable, capital-efficient growth, strong product-market fit, and healthy margins. These are the businesses that will define the AI era.

### The New Moats

1. **Memory and context are the new moats:** Products that remember, adapt, and personalize create emotional and functional lock-in
2. **Systems of action are replacing systems of record:** AI-native apps don't just store data, they act on it
3. **Start with an AI wedge:** Solve a narrow, high-friction problem, deliver 10x value fast, then expand

### Market Timing

- Average time from seed to Series A: **2.4 years** (budget accordingly)
- Retention is table stakes, growth without retention is a leaky bucket
- The browser is becoming the canvas for agentic AI
